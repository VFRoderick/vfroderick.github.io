# Senior GIS Developer

I build and scale the technical foundations required for complex spatial data. My work focuses on backend architecture: databases, APIs, and automation pipelines that make high-performance mapping possible.

At Mortenson, I proposed and implemented our first ArcGIS Enterprise system and helped scale adoption across the organization.

## Professional Experience and Impact

### Systems Architecture and DevOps

- Proposed and led the transition to ArcGIS Enterprise, scaling adoption from hundreds to thousands of entitlements.
- Built a standardized Docker + reverse-proxy dev environment to support multiple app versions cleanly.
- Developed CI/CD pipelines and automation for database maintenance and deployment workflows.
- Created ArcGIS Monitor dashboards for node-based health and root-cause analysis.

### Custom Spatial Solutions

- Developed Java/Scala tooling around MPXJ to unify construction scheduling formats into a single data model.
- Designed optimized SQL Server geodatabases with automation for high-frequency updates.
- Implemented real-time telemetry workflows using GeoEvent Server and fleet/asset tracking integrations.
- Engineered a Utility Network dataset for complex material tracking on large-scale projects.
